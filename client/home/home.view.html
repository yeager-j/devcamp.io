        <p>Coding bootcamps are becoming extremely popular. Lots of students are beginning to turn to these programs
            instead of college because they are cheaper and usually more immersive. This website serves as a community
            where students and instructors alike can have a real conversation.</p>

        <p>The main feature of the website is the forums. Anyone can create a thread and reply to threads. When a thread
            gets popular, it will be featured on the Blog page. Each user has a profile that contains all of their
            content, whether they are a (prospective) student or instructor, and their location. Users can follow other
            users.</p>
